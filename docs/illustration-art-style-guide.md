# Illustration Art Style Guide

## Overview

This document defines the artistic style and visual approach for illustrations used throughout the Open Libra website. The illustration style combines abstract expressionist geometric principles with our brand identity, creating sophisticated, modern visuals that support our institutional positioning while maintaining artistic elegance.

## Core Art Style Principles

### **1. Abstract Expressionist Geometry**

Our illustrations draw inspiration from abstract expressionist movement, specifically focusing on geometric abstraction and the techniques reminiscent of paper cutout art.

#### **Key Characteristics:**
- **Geometric Abstraction**: Clean, purposeful shapes that suggest rather than literally represent concepts
- **Cutout Paper Aesthetic**: Layered geometric forms that appear hand-cut and assembled
- **Organic Within Structure**: While geometric, shapes may have subtle organic curves that prevent rigidity
- **Compositional Balance**: Asymmetrical yet balanced arrangements that create visual harmony

#### **Artistic Influences:**
- Henri Matisse's paper cutouts (Jazz series)
- Piet Mondrian's geometric compositions
- Alexander Calder's abstract forms
- Contemporary digital collage art

### **2. Visual Metaphors & Concepts**

Illustrations should communicate complex financial and technological concepts through abstract visual language:

- **Networks & Connectivity**: Overlapping geometric shapes, intersecting lines
- **Growth & Progress**: Ascending compositions, expanding forms
- **Stability & Security**: Balanced compositions, strong foundational shapes
- **Innovation & Future**: Dynamic arrangements, unexpected shape relationships
- **Institutional Strength**: Bold, confident geometric structures

## Color Palette for Illustrations

### **Primary Brand Colors**
- **Brand Red**: `#E75A5C`
  - Usage: Dominant shapes, key focal points
  - Properties: Commands attention, creates visual hierarchy

- **Brand Cream**: `#FAF3E7`
  - Usage: Background elements, subtle shapes, negative space
  - Properties: Provides contrast, softens composition

### **Extended Pastel Palette**

To expand the visual vocabulary while maintaining brand cohesion:

#### **Warm Pastels**
- **Soft Coral**: `#F5A5A5` (Tinted Brand Red)
- **Peachy Cream**: `#F7E5D3` (Warmer cream variation)
- **Dusty Rose**: `#E8B4B8` (Muted pink-red)

#### **Cool Pastels**
- **Sage Mint**: `#D4E5D0` (Subtle green)
- **Powder Blue**: `#D0E0E8` (Soft blue)
- **Lavender Gray**: `#E0D8E5` (Muted purple)

#### **Neutral Creams**
- **Warm Ivory**: `#F8F4EE` (Slightly warmer than brand cream)
- **Cool Linen**: `#F5F5F0` (Slightly cooler variation)
- **Soft Beige**: `#F0EBE3` (Deeper cream tone)

### **Color Usage Guidelines**

1. **Hierarchy**: Brand Red should dominate (40-50% of composition)
2. **Balance**: Pastels support and complement (30-40% of composition)
3. **Breathing Room**: Cream/neutral spaces provide rest (10-20% of composition)
4. **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility
5. **Harmony**: Maximum of 4-5 colors per illustration

## Composition & Form Guidelines

### **Shape Language**

#### **Primary Shapes**
- **Circles & Ellipses**: Suggest unity, continuity, cycles
- **Rectangles & Squares**: Represent stability, structure, foundations
- **Triangles**: Indicate direction, growth, change
- **Organic Curves**: Add humanity and approachability

#### **Shape Characteristics**
- **Clean Edges**: Crisp, defined boundaries (cutout paper effect)
- **Layered Depth**: Overlapping creates visual interest and depth
- **Varied Sizes**: Mix of large dominant shapes with smaller accent forms
- **Purposeful Positioning**: Each shape serves the overall composition

### **Composition Principles**

#### **Layout Strategies**
1. **Rule of Thirds**: Position key elements along grid intersections
2. **Asymmetrical Balance**: Create stability through varied visual weights
3. **Visual Flow**: Guide the eye through intentional shape placement
4. **Negative Space**: Use cream/neutral areas as active compositional elements

#### **Depth & Layering**
- **Foreground**: Bold shapes in Brand Red or strong pastels
- **Midground**: Supporting shapes in medium-toned pastels
- **Background**: Subtle shapes in cream variations or light pastels
- **Shadows**: Subtle transparency overlays (10-20% opacity)

### **Scale & Proportion**

- **Dominant Elements**: 30-50% of composition area
- **Supporting Elements**: 15-25% each
- **Accent Details**: 5-10% each
- **Breathing Room**: 20-30% negative space

## Technical Specifications

### **File Formats & Requirements**

#### **Vector Graphics (Preferred)**
- **Format**: SVG for web, AI/EPS for print
- **Benefits**: Scalable, crisp edges, small file sizes
- **Optimization**: Clean paths, minimal anchor points

### **Accessibility Standards**

- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for text overlays
- **Color Independence**: Illustrations convey meaning without relying solely on color
- **Alt Text Ready**: Compositions that can be described meaningfully
- **Scalability**: Readable at various sizes (minimum 200px width)

## Application Guidelines

### **Website Integration**

#### **Hero Sections**
- Large-scale geometric compositions
- Strong Brand Red presence
- Horizontal orientations preferred
- 16:9 or 21:9 aspect ratios

#### **Section Dividers**
- Subtle geometric accents
- Primarily pastel colors
- Minimal Brand Red usage
- Various orientations

#### **Icon Systems**
- Simplified geometric forms
- Single or two-color maximum
- Square or circular boundaries
- Consistent visual weight

#### **Background Elements**
- Large, subtle shapes
- Low opacity (10-30%)
- Primarily cream and light pastels
- Non-distracting placement

### **Content Support**

#### **Data Visualization Integration**
- Geometric forms that complement charts/graphs
- Colors that don't compete with data
- Abstract representations of financial concepts

#### **Conceptual Illustrations**
- Complex financial/tech concepts simplified
- Metaphorical rather than literal representation
- Support for multiple languages/cultures
