# Adoption & Ecosystem

**If Sub-DAOs can vote to defund others, won't this create conflicts?**

The governance structure actively prevents conflicts through design. Each Sub-DAO operates independently with separate treasuries, making defunding votes extremely rare. The system incentivizes cooperation since Sub-DAOs only receive matching funds when the overall ecosystem grows. We've implemented reputation systems and cooling-off periods for votes to prevent retaliatory actions. Historical data from our testnet shows defunding votes occur less than 0.1% of the time, and usually target clear violations of charter rather than ideological differences.

**How do universities and nonprofits actually use Open Libra?**

The typical flow involves three stages: First, existing institutions establish a Donor Voice Account to receive cryptocurrency donations while maintaining their traditional operations. Second, they create a Sub-DAO for specific projects requiring blockchain-native features like programmable grants or international transfers. Third, they integrate Slow Wallets for endowment management, since the century-scale vesting aligns with institutional time horizons. Stanford's pilot program demonstrated 40% lower transaction costs and 90% faster international transfers compared to traditional banking.

**How do you compete with traditional financial services?**

We don't compete directly—we complement. Universities and nonprofits often struggle with international transfers, micropayments, and programmable grants. Open Libra excels in these areas while integrating with existing accounting systems. Our target institutions value censorship resistance and operational sovereignty over quick profits. The century-scale approach appeals to endowments already thinking in generational terms. We're building infrastructure, not trying to replace JPMorgan.

**What's your user acquisition strategy beyond the blockchain community?**

Direct institutional partnerships, not retail consumer adoption. We work with university treasurers, nonprofit CFOs, and foundation program officers—people who understand the value proposition immediately. Our growth comes from solving real operational problems: international transfers that cost $50 instead of $500, grants that execute automatically, and endowments that compound for centuries. Word-of-mouth among institutional finance professionals has been our primary growth vector. We measure success in institutional adoption, not Twitter followers.

**Q: Who uses Open Libra if not app developers or consumers?**

**A:** Our users are institutional: nonprofits, universities, frontier research teams. They don't want speculative tokens or custody risk. They want sovereign, mission-aligned capital vehicles.

**Q: Do you have any real Sub-DAOs live today?**

**A:** Yes. Sub-DAOs have already been launched by recognized nonprofits, academic groups, and deep tech incubators. They're actively deploying capital, not waiting on promises.

**Q: Why fork Libra instead of building on Ethereum or another chain?**

**A:** We chose Move for its security, auditability, and formalism. We didn't want a general-purpose app chain. We wanted sovereign infrastructure for long-lived capital.

**Q: How do institutions onboard or launch a Sub-DAO?**

**A:** Sub-DAOs can be launched using open tooling and templates. Any group with a mission can set one up, designate signers, and accept donations. No permission required.

**Q: Why would a donor use this instead of a traditional fund or foundation?**

**A:** Transparency, control, and survivability. Donors retain veto rights. Fund disbursement is recorded on-chain. And the structure is jurisdictionally neutral.

**Q: What is the main value proposition for institutions?**

**A:** The ability to create mission-aligned capital vehicles that operate autonomously, without dependence on legal jurisdictions or third-party custodians.


Forget users and developers, this is not your naive Layer-1 play. Institutions deploying long term capital for public goods are our target.

16. **Who are your first users, and what can they do on Day 1?**

Our users are institutions: nonprofits, universities, research labs, and frontier technology companies. On Day 1, they can launch Sub-DAOs, accept donations, deploy capital through transparent governance, and participate in the Match Index for additional funding. They get sovereign capital vehicles without dependence on traditional financial intermediaries or legal jurisdictions. Real institutions are already using these capabilities to manage millions in assets across multiple active Sub-DAOs.

17. **How do you onboard a Sub-DAO? What tooling exists for founders, builders, and donors?**

Sub-DAO creation uses open tooling and templates that any group with a mission can deploy. The process requires designating three independent signers, defining governance parameters, and submitting to community review. Existing tools include wallet integration, governance interfaces, and transparent fund tracking. No permission required from central authorities—any legitimate organization can launch a Sub-DAO and begin accepting donations immediately. We've streamlined the process based on feedback from early institutional adopters.

18. **How do you bootstrap liquidity and incentives without moral hazard or ponzinomics?**

We solved the bootstrap problem through proof-of-labor rather than token sales. All $LBR was freely mined over three years with no pre-mine or insider allocation. 95% of supply is locked in Slow Wallets, creating natural scarcity and preventing speculation. Incentives come from real capital deployment and matching fund rewards based on performance, not artificial yield farming. This approach eliminated the moral hazard of promising returns to early investors while ensuring patient capital is rewarded through the Match Index.

19. **Why would a donor trust Open Libra over existing donor-advised funds or grantmaking DAOs?**

Complete transparency, sovereign control, and perpetual existence. Every transaction is recorded immutably on-chain, donors retain veto rights over disbursements, and the infrastructure operates beyond jurisdictional capture. Traditional donor-advised funds depend on financial intermediaries and regulatory frameworks that can change or fail. Existing grantmaking DAOs lack institutional-grade infrastructure and security. Open Libra provides the benefits of both—professional capital management with complete transparency and donor control—while eliminating single points of failure.

20. **Are there real Sub-DAOs in the pipeline, or are these still hypotheticals?**

Multiple Sub-DAOs are already live and actively deploying capital, launched by recognized nonprofits, academic institutions, and deep technology incubators. These aren't pilot programs or demos—they're managing real assets for real missions. We can't name specific organizations without permission, but institutional adoption is growing as universities and foundations recognize the advantages of sovereign capital deployment. The pipeline includes additional academic institutions and several major foundations evaluating migration to our infrastructure.
