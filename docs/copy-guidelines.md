# 📝 Open Libra Web Copy Guidelines

## 🥇 First Rule: Always Be a Straight Shooter

- Say what you mean. Don’t hedge, overhype, or bury the lead.
- If something is a risk, name it. If something is a strength, own it.
- Crypto is full of smoke. Open Libra isn't.

## 📌 Context

We’re writing for two skeptical but essential audiences:

1. **Crypto Enthusiasts**
   Often mean, deeply skeptical, and reasoning almost entirely by analogy. They don't trust new ideas unless they rhyme with old ones. They anchor to memes, tropes, and past cycles. They’re allergic to idealism unless it’s wrapped in profit or revolution. Assume short attention spans and cultural fluency with Ethereum, Solana, memecoins, governance wars, and “ponzinomics.”

2. **Institutional Minds** (MBAs, founders, analysts, ex-Wall Street types)
   Smart, practical, and allergic to bullshit. These are people who understand risk, incentives, and strategy. They don’t need hype—they need clarity. They respect strong, well-reasoned positioning and zero tolerance for magical thinking.

Our challenge is to **earn credibility with both.** That means: speak plainly, write sharply, and always ground claims in logic and relevance.

## ✍️ Tone & Voice

| Trait         | Implementation                                       |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Straightforward** | Get to the point. Speak with conviction. No fluff. |
| **Crisp**     | Short sentences. Strong verbs. Declarative tone.    |
| **Precise**   | Use exact terms, not abstractions. Define everything. |
| **Anchored**  | New ideas must be introduced through familiar ones. |
| **Credible**  | Preempt skepticism. Answer before they ask.         |
| **Institutional** | Sound like a sovereign fund, not a Discord mod. |

## 🧠 Core Messaging Principles

### 1. **Anchor Every Innovation**
- Use analogy to explain unfamiliar mechanics:
  *“Like a family office that runs on-chain.”*
  *“Like a long-duration endowment, but incorruptible.”*

### 2. **Don’t Hide the Ball**
- If something is complicated, admit it — then break it down.
  Respect the reader’s intelligence, but never assume trust.

### 3. **Make Integrity the Product**
- We’re not selling a trend. We’re building the only vehicle designed to steward capital in the post-human, AI-governed era.
  The product is its own defense.

### 4. **Frame AI as Infrastructure**
- Don’t sell “AI.”
  Sell the inflection, and the uncertainty of what capital looks like in the next century.

### 5. **Justify the Stack**
- Why blockchain? Why a token? Why a DAO?
  Blockchain is an institutional vehicle. DAO just means new people come and go. Token is a title to residuals which may or may not be imagined.

## ⚠️ Red Flags to Avoid

- **Fluff**
  If you wouldn’t say it in a boardroom, don’t say it on the homepage.

- **Crypto Kool-Aid**
  Avoid tribal language, memes, slogans, or empty virtue signals.

- **MBA Jargon**
  “Scalable synergies” and “leveraging digital innovation” = 🚫

- **Unverified Claims**
  Everything stated must be defendable. If it sounds magical, rewrite it.

## ✅ What Success Looks Like

- A crypto veteran says: *“This actually sounds serious.”*
- A finance professional says: *“I don’t need to believe in crypto to see why this works.”*
- Everyone leaves with more clarity than they arrived with.

## 🧩 Example Phrasing

- “A programmable endowment designed to survive human error.”
- “Governance doesn’t rely on trust — it relies on code.”
- “Like a sovereign wealth fund, but incorruptible.”
- “Built to invest beyond regimes, cycles, and lifespans.”

## 📌 Final Rule

> **If you can't explain it to a crypto degen and a Goldman analyst in the same sentence — rewrite it.**
