## 1. Yes, We Took It

**What do you mean "We hard-forked Facebook out of Libra."?**

Facebook spent hundreds of millions of dollars to create a clean-slate extreme high performance blockchain. Much of the public worried about what their stable coin would mean for the future of finance. I, on the other hand, saw that there was an opportunity to steal it back from them, to create a perpetual asset which, like bitcoin, had a much longer-term view. In 2019 my friends saw this opportunity, including some people tangentially involved in Facebook's Libra project.

The starting point was: if we don't need to spend hundreds of millions on technical R&D, how do we design the best asset for all generations to come?

## 2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital

**What does "good capital" mean?**

Capital is anything physical or immaterial that provides value to the owner. One of the fascinating features of Bitcoin when invented was that an immaterial right was not a "title" granted by someone else and later revoked. Titles in many cases are just the right to use somethingâ€”you never actually really own land. "Your keys, your coins" is an improvement on intangible capital.

What Bitcoin and successors have sacrificed is the "good" properties: where is the rent going to come from? Mostly this is because of regulations in modern countries: being explicit about a financial asset generating a dividend automatically labels the product a "security." Violating securities laws is painful; countries take this very seriously (as they should). From my vantage, what I see is that silence by blockchain founders on the matter of rent is intentionally confusing, which usually only benefits an insider class.

To be good capital you need to try harder: create assets that are not securities and place them in environments where people want to produce rent in abundance. A car is not a security; a car in the desert produces no rent. A car in a city easily produces rent.

There's another definition of "good," which is the capitalized Good, as in righteousness. Historically acquiring capital is often zero sum: you take land from someone else. Today, still our collective instincts around capital accumulation are that the formidable, aggressive, and deceptive will win. Though this is still the norm, in some pockets of the world economy where new value comes from innovations which maximize satisfying needs, we see the effect of positive-sum games. Abundance should allow us to stop allowing anti-social elements from accumulating and controlling value.

The crypto industry could try harder to create good capital, but their current recipe seems to work fine for near-sighted goals. Here at LIBRA, I think it's best just to move on and focus on launching a new industry: Open Assets.

## 3. By Producing the Best Open Asset

**What is an "Open Asset"?**

It's the thing that comes after crypto.

The origin story of crypto is interesting; the early innovations were critical for getting peer-to-peer digital property. But it's time to move away from the nonsense which creates the space for toxicity, scams, and destruction of value.

Alternative currency is amusing, but over decades it will suffer the same fate as fiat; the general demise of the need at all for currencies when assets have hyper-liquid markets. Web3 may become the future of the human internet, but the infrastructure will likely never be profitable enough to produce any rent, and if your time horizons are long enough, then you should be thinking about how superintelligence will obviate our current networked systems. DAOs, protocols, and platforms are undifferentiated from companies, except that they share the efficiency of kindergartens. (See plans measured in centuries).

LIBRA is an accessible and perpetual digital property.

It is carefully designed for its purpose: capital.

Prosperity comes from people saving and planning for transformation.

**The entire LIBRA supply has already been produced, and remarkably our users saved, pledged, or donated 95% of their assets for the future.**

**What do you mean "pledged to the future"?**

At the end of bootstrapping (V7), between slow wallets, infra escrow pledge, and different donor-directed accounts, the network had 95% of the capital locked for the future. Bootstrapping was slow, nearly 3 years of mining. At V7 upgrade, approximately 5% LIBRA was circulating unrestricted.

**What do you mean by "government proof"?**

A free mined asset that never raised capital is not a philosophical question; it's a commercial opportunity. If you want to take your asset mainstream it has to be safe and reputable. If you can achieve those two qualities, it fits in everyone's plans from the humblest family up to titanic institutions.

Safe: If no one ever needs to look over their shoulder at governments, then you can begin gaining the trust of the 95% who think anything related to blockchain is a scam. This includes early maintainers, later the users, and further along those who make plans for multiple generations.

## 4. Which is Fiercely Independent

We make correct choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.

- Government proof: every coin was mined and no money ever raised.
- No Labs or Foundation: yes to moral authority and meritocracy.
- So long, Crypto industry: we'll play games the world wants to play.
- No thanks, VCs: we have no rush, and infinite possibilities.

## 5. Uses Modern Tools

Having our own Layer-1 blockchain ensures LIBRA's freedom. We've been running high-performance Diem and Move networks since 2019. The chain is meant to have all the smart contracts anyone would need to use, save, plan with LIBRA, but none of the nonsense to distract us. Think LIBRA, not Blockchain.

## 6. Has Plans Measured in Centuries

We play a long game that few have patience for. There is a desert to cross, though the prize is worth the sacrifice.

**You surely don't mean "measured in centuries"?**

Yes, of course we do. There are plenty of types of capital that last generations: buildings, land titles, financial firms, bonds. There are existing government bonds that have been paying out continuously for 400 years. But one thing nearly never does: technologies, and technology companies.

We are not saying you need to wait decades to use and benefit from it.
We play a long game that few have patience for.

The thing that outlives technology is content. And financial content is simply another word for assets.

To me, the most compelling thing about the assets on blockchain is an overlooked fundamental property: their risk of disappearing is very low. They don't die like companies. This changes a lot of financial equations, principally your discount rate. If your rent can be had distantly into the future, a century away even, then no matter the discount you apply, the value is always not zero. And if you start from this position, that the time horizon is much longer than we are accustomed to, an entirely new design space opens up.

## 7. To Become an Unstoppable Force

All future generations should have dependable capital for interventions in society.

Having power in society requires capital. In the next century, I expect this to continue being true, if not more so.
