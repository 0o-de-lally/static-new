# What is the product?
The product is the token.
- We have an asset that has been fully mined
- 95% of the assets are vested, or pledged to investment vehicles

# What is the infrastructure?
- A hyper performant blockchain based on Facebook/Diem's Move language
- People can programmatically interact with blockchain smart contracts, and issue smart transaction scripts (they cannot publish new modules).

# Are you a Move smart contract platform?
We have one, but probably not in the way you think.

The entire LIBRA system runs itself on Move smart contracts.

Core developers update and add new modules with new programs. End users can program Move transaction scripts (small programs to run within the life of a transaction).

The engineering goal is to have all of the smart contracts which allow people to use LIBRA for saving and planning. We are more inspired by Bitcoin as a model for infrastructure, and are not optimizing to be a general compute platform like Ethereum.

# Can I deploy a meme coin on your blockchain?
No.

# How do you add apps?

Apps are updated by consensus. We call this the Ascencion Protocol. Only apps which augment the capabilities of $LBR or the DAO, are considered for upgrade.

I.e. It's very easy to write great programs, but you must create a very persuasive and logical business case for why a program should be added to the blockchain.

# Why is it strategically important to prevent permissionless deployment
Because we think L1 blockchains, over time, are barges of garbage in a red ocean of compute. This is opposite of creating durable, perpetual capital. Let's commit computer, labor, and intellectual resources to making $LBR the best asset it can possibly be, not a hypothetical world computer.
