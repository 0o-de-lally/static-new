# Foundational Vision & Strategy

### TL;DR
Digital assets don't die. That's their superpower. But most chains treat them like software startups, instead of durable capital. Knowing that is half the battle. The other half: real capital must compound in value.

**Why do you believe an on-chain endowment can succeed where traditional institutions fail?**

Traditional institutions are constrained by three fatal flaws: jurisdictional boundaries, key-man risk, and institutional fragility. They exist at the mercy of governments, depend on centralized management, and can be dissolved by regulatory pressure or internal corruption. An on-chain endowment eliminates these single points of failure through technical sovereignty, decentralized governance, and immutable programmability. We've already proven this works—we've survived attacks, exploits, and regulatory pressure that would have killed traditional institutions. When Facebook shuttered Libra under government pressure, we forked the code and deployed it in a truly decentralized manner. Traditional endowments can't fork themselves out of regulatory capture.

**What would success look like in 1 year, 10 years, and 100 years? Be concrete.**

**1 Year:** A thriving ecosystem of 50+ Sub-DAOs managing $100M+ in combined assets, with institutional adoption by universities and nonprofits. Complete technical infrastructure for sovereign capital deployment, including mature tooling for Sub-DAO creation and management.

**10 Years:** Open Libra becomes one of the world's largest endowments with $10B+ in assets under management across hundreds of specialized Sub-DAOs. Recognition as the premier platform for institutional-grade decentralized capital allocation, with major foundations and endowments migrating to our infrastructure.

**100 Years:** Open Libra persists as an antifragile financial institution that has survived multiple technological paradigm shifts, regulatory regimes, and economic cycles. $LBR tokens serve as the premier store of value for patient capital, with Sub-DAOs stewarding trillions in assets for global public goods.

**Why fork Libra/Diem instead of building on existing L1s like Ethereum or Solana?**

Infrastructure sovereignty is non-negotiable for century-scale institutions. Ethereum's gas fees and governance capture by DeFi speculators make it unsuitable for serious institutional capital. Solana's centralization and frequent outages disqualify it for mission-critical operations. Libra/Diem was engineered by Facebook's team of 200+ world-class engineers specifically for institutional-grade financial applications. The Move language provides enhanced security through resource-oriented programming, and the system was designed for global financial institution scale. By forking Diem, we inherited battle-tested infrastructure while gaining complete control over our destiny.

**Is "century-scale" a metaphor, or do you expect to build systems that literally persist that long?**

Literally centuries. There are government bonds paying out continuously for 400+ years. Buildings, land titles, and financial firms regularly persist across generations. The fundamental difference is eliminating single points of failure: no company, no jurisdiction, no centralized management. We've engineered antifragile governance that becomes stronger through attempted attacks. Our discount rate calculations assume literally perpetual cash flows, which opens entirely new design spaces for capital allocation. Unlike technology companies that die, blockchain assets have very low risk of disappearing, fundamentally changing the financial equations for long-term value creation.

**What gives Open Libra any real chance of lasting 100 years?**

The absence of single points of failure: no company, no VC cap table, no custodian. Fork-based governance, freely mined assets, and redundant leadership make the system resilient. We've already survived where others folded.

4. **How do you reconcile "perpetual autonomy" with inevitable protocol upgrades, governance crises, or validator churn?**

We learned from Bitcoin: governance-minimized protocol design reduces formal authority and allows innovation at the edges. Our core protocol remains intentionally ossified—fundamental rules for $LBR issuance, consensus, and basic operations resist change. This provides stability for century-scale planning. Innovation happens through our Sub-DAO ecosystem where specialized governance can experiment without compromising base layer integrity. All changes happen through hard forks with independent validator adoption, forcing multipolar negotiation and protecting against capture. We've already proven this works under stress.
