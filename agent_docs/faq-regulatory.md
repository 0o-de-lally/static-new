# Regulatory & Legal Framework

## Our Legal Position

Open Libra operates as neutral infrastructure—like email protocols or cloud services. No tokens were sold. No funds were pooled. No returns were promised. Every $LBR token was freely mined. We provide software; institutions handle their own compliance.

Six years of operation. Zero legal challenges. Adoption by legitimate institutions. Clean foundation.

## 1. Are $LBR tokens securities?

No. Tokens were never sold—only mined. The protocol doesn't pool funds or promise returns. $LBR functions like Ethereum gas: transaction fees and governance weights.

Sub-DAOs may pool funds, but that's downstream behavior by autonomous entities. Most existing Sub-DAOs are donation-based nonprofits, not investment vehicles.

## 2. How do institutions handle KYC/AML compliance?

Institutions implement their own procedures appropriate to their jurisdiction. A Swiss university has different obligations than a Kenyan nonprofit.

Open Libra provides compliance tools—transaction monitoring, address clustering, reporting integration with Chainalysis and Elliptic. We don't impose uniform requirements.

The goal: regulatory harmony, not arbitrage.

## 3. What about regulatory crackdowns on blockchain?

Our institutional focus and governance-minimized design provide protection. We're not:
- Promising yields to retail investors
- Facilitating anonymous payments
- Operating as an unregistered securities platform

Our users are established institutions with compliance teams and regulatory relationships. If jurisdictions restrict blockchain use, affected institutions can fork the protocol with appropriate modifications.

## 4. How do you handle international sanctions?

Each institution remains responsible for sanctions compliance in their jurisdiction. We provide screening tools and maintain relationships with sanctions providers, but don't enforce uniform policies.

If an institution faces new requirements, they implement controls at their Sub-DAO level without affecting the global network.

## 5. What if a Sub-DAO does something controversial?

Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities responsible for their own legal compliance. The protocol provides infrastructure but exercises no control over decisions.

This is identical to how email servers aren't liable for user communications or cloud providers aren't responsible for customer applications.

If a Sub-DAO violates local law, consequences fall on that entity—not the neutral protocol.

## 6. How do you explain legality to skeptics?

**To regulators:** We operate like internet infrastructure. No ICO, no fundraising, no promises. Six years without legal challenges. Institutions handle their own compliance.

**To journalists:** We're software that enables autonomous capital deployment. Like email protocols—neutral infrastructure that users deploy according to their local laws.

**To investors:** Clean legal foundation with institutional adoption. Protocol remains outside securities regulation while enabling compliance at the application level.

## 7. Do you impose KYC requirements?

No. The protocol is neutral infrastructure like Bitcoin or Ethereum.

We avoid fund manager classification because we don't manage funds, pool capital, or promise returns. Sub-DAOs may implement KYC based on local law.

Fund management happens at the Sub-DAO level, not the protocol level.

## 8. How does community culture prevent bad actors?

Open Libra operates within the law and believes culture matters. We have a six-year history of pro-social activities that creates strong community norms.

Anti-social actors get mitigated through fork-based governance. If a Sub-DAO acts against community values, legitimate operators can fork away from bad actors. This threat is real and sufficient to maintain standards.

The community routinely develops its own norms around acceptable behavior. Legal compliance is the floor, and cultural alignment is what builds lasting institutions.

## 9. What's your jurisdictional strategy?

We operate as neutral infrastructure without geographic restrictions. The protocol imposes no jurisdictional preferences—it's software running on decentralized infrastructure.

We engage regulators through education and industry participation while maintaining technical sovereignty. Sub-DAOs handle local compliance requirements.

Blockchains operate within the law. Our approach: legal compliance plus strong cultural governance through community norms and fork-based accountability.
