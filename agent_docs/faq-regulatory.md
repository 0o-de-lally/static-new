# Regulatory & Legal Framework

**What's your regulatory status? How do you handle compliance?**

Open Libra is designed as utility infrastructure, not a security. The $LBR token functions purely as transaction fees and governance weights—similar to Ethereum's model. We work with qualified institutions who have existing compliance frameworks. Since Sub-DAOs operate within established nonprofits and universities, they inherit existing regulatory protections. Our legal strategy focuses on supporting institutions who already understand their compliance obligations rather than trying to navigate retail regulations. Every major deployment includes compliance review with the institution's existing legal counsel.

**How do you handle KYC/AML requirements for institutions?**

Institutions implement their own KYC/AML procedures appropriate to their jurisdiction. Open Libra provides the infrastructure tools—transaction monitoring, address clustering, compliance reporting—but doesn't impose uniform requirements. A university in Switzerland has different obligations than a nonprofit in Kenya. We've integrated with leading compliance platforms like Chainalysis and Elliptic to provide the data institutions need for their reporting. The goal is regulatory harmony, not regulatory arbitrage.

**What about potential regulatory crackdowns on blockchain?**

Open Libra's institutional focus and governance-minimized design provide significant regulatory protection. We're not promising yields to retail investors or facilitating anonymous payments. Our users are established institutions with compliance teams and regulatory relationships. The century-scale timeline means we can adapt to evolving regulations while maintaining core functionality. If specific jurisdictions restrict blockchain use, affected institutions can fork the protocol with jurisdiction-appropriate modifications. The antifragile design principle specifically accounts for regulatory pressure.

**How do you handle international sanctions and compliance across borders?**

Each institution remains responsible for sanctions compliance in their jurisdiction. Open Libra provides tools for transaction monitoring and address screening, but doesn't enforce uniform policies. If an institution faces new sanctions requirements, they can implement appropriate controls at their Sub-DAO level without affecting the broader network. The modular architecture ensures that compliance requirements in one region don't create operational constraints globally. We maintain relationships with leading sanctions screening providers to ensure institutions have access to current watchlists and compliance tools.



**Q: Are your tokens securities? Are you worried about regulators?**

**A:** No tokens were sold. All coins were mined freely. The protocol does not pool funds or promise returns. Sub-DAOs may pool funds, but that's downstream behavior. Most existing Sub-DAOs are donation-based. The protocol remains neutral.

**Q: How do you handle legal risk if a Sub-DAO does something controversial?**

**A:** Open Libra provides infrastructure. Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities that must comply with local laws. The protocol has no custodial control or enforcement powers. It's software. But all known sub-DAOs have a strong cultural alignment with the mission: they are philanthropic or pro-social.

**Q: Is there any KYC or AML compliance?**

**A:** The protocol itself imposes no KYC. It is neutral infrastructure. Sub-DAOs or donors operating in regulated jurisdictions are responsible for compliance. This keeps the base layer credibly neutral.

**Q: Could any part of the system be considered a financial instrument?**

**A:** The protocol issues no promises and does not facilitate investment. It enables sovereign capital deployment via code. Any regulatory classification would have to apply to a user behavior, not the base protocol.


Open Libra never sold tokens or raised capital into the protocol. Every coin was freely mined, and any pooling of capital happens downstream — by users, not by the chain. Most existing sub-DAOs were donation-based, not investment vehicles.

21. **What's your jurisdictional posture? Do you plan to geo-fence, anonymize, or engage regulators?**

We operate as neutral infrastructure without jurisdictional preference. The protocol itself imposes no geographic restrictions—it's software that runs on decentralized infrastructure. Sub-DAOs operating in regulated jurisdictions are responsible for local compliance, keeping the base layer credibly neutral. We engage regulators through educational outreach and industry participation but maintain technical sovereignty. Our clean legal foundation (no ICO, no fundraising) provides strong protection against regulatory overreach while enabling constructive engagement where appropriate.

22. **How do you explain the project's legality to a skeptical journalist, regulator, or institutional investor?**

Open Libra operates as neutral software infrastructure, similar to the internet protocols that enable email or web browsing. Every $LBR token was fairly mined with no sales or securities offerings. The protocol pools no funds and promises no returns—it simply enables autonomous capital deployment through code. Sub-DAOs are separate legal entities responsible for their own compliance. Our regulatory position is strengthened by six years of operation without legal challenges and adoption by legitimate institutions. We provide the rails; users are responsible for their own regulatory compliance.

23. **What parts of the system could be considered financial instruments or securities under U.S. law?**

The base protocol issues no promises and facilitates no investments—it's neutral infrastructure. $LBR tokens were freely mined and represent computational access rights, not investment contracts. Sub-DAOs might trigger securities law if they pool funds and promise returns, but most operate as donation-based entities focused on public goods. Our legal analysis suggests the protocol itself remains outside securities regulation, though specific Sub-DAO implementations could require compliance depending on their structure and jurisdiction. This separation protects the base layer while enabling regulatory compliance at the application level.

24. **Is there any KYC? If not, how do you avoid being classified as an unregistered fund manager?**

The protocol imposes no KYC requirements—it's neutral infrastructure like Bitcoin or Ethereum. We avoid fund manager classification because we don't manage funds, pool capital, or promise returns. Open Libra provides software tools; Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities that may implement their own KYC requirements based on local law. This architectural separation ensures the base protocol remains legally neutral while enabling compliance at the application layer. Fund management happens at the Sub-DAO level, not the protocol level.

Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities responsible for their own legal compliance and risk management. The protocol provides infrastructure but exercises no control over Sub-DAO decisions. If a Sub-DAO violates local law, consequences fall on that entity and its operators, not the neutral protocol. This is identical to how email servers aren't liable for user communications or how cloud providers aren't responsible for customer applications. Our decentralized architecture ensures that problems with individual Sub-DAOs don't compromise the broader ecosystem or protocol operation.
