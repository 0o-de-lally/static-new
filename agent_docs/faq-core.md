**Appendix: FAQ & Rebuttals**

### I. Protocol Governance & Upgrades

**Q: How do you govern the protocol without a foundation or Labs entity?**
**A:** Governance is minimized by design. There is no foundation, no Labs, and no privileged upgrade path. All changes happen through hard forks. Validators must independently choose to adopt new software. This forces multipolar negotiation and protects against capture.

**Q: Isn't your governance too minimal? What happens in an emergency?**
**A:** Minimal doesn’t mean brittle. We've already faced attacks and exploits. We mitigated them using software upgrades, validator coordination, and even legal prosecution. This is not hypothetical. It’s battle-tested.

**Q: How do you reconcile perpetuity with necessary protocol upgrades?**
**A:** All blockchains must upgrade, and Open Libra does so through fork-based negotiation. There is no upgrade authority — only alignment between validators and the broader community. That process has already succeeded under stress.

**Q: What’s your governance upgrade path if something breaks catastrophically?**
**A:** The same path that works today: coordinated action by independent validators, backed by social consensus. No multisig, no emergency powers. Just resilient infrastructure and reputation-weighted influence.

**Q: What gives Open Libra any real chance of lasting 100 years?**
**A:** The absence of single points of failure: no company, no VC cap table, no custodian. Fork-based governance, freely mined assets, and redundant leadership make the system resilient. We've already survived where others folded.

### II. Regulatory Posture

**Q: Are your tokens securities? Are you worried about regulators?**
**A:** No tokens were sold. All coins were mined freely. The protocol does not pool funds or promise returns. Sub-DAOs may pool funds, but that’s downstream behavior. Most existing Sub-DAOs are donation-based. The protocol remains neutral.

**Q: How do you handle legal risk if a Sub-DAO does something controversial?**
**A:** Open Libra provides infrastructure. Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities that must comply with local laws. The protocol has no custodial control or enforcement powers. It’s software. But all known sub-DAOs have a strong cultural alignment with the mission: they are philanthropic or pro-social.

**Q: Is there any KYC or AML compliance?**
**A:** The protocol itself imposes no KYC. It is neutral infrastructure. Sub-DAOs or donors operating in regulated jurisdictions are responsible for compliance. This keeps the base layer credibly neutral.

**Q: Could any part of the system be considered a financial instrument?**
**A:** The protocol issues no promises and does not facilitate investment. It enables sovereign capital deployment via code. Any regulatory classification would have to apply to a user behavior, not the base protocol.

### III. Economic Design & Security

**Q: What are Slow Wallets, and how do they work?**
**A:** Slow Wallets are enforced in protocol logic. They distribute funds daily with no way to accelerate vesting. This reduces volatility, limits speculation, and encourages long-term participation. This "First in–Last Out" mechanism creates a game theoretic equilibrium which reduces private insider advantages.

**Q: How does the matching system for Sub-DAOs avoid abuse?**
**A:** Matching is based on time-weighted donations. Newer donations carry more weight. Each Sub-DAO requires 3 unrelated signers, and donors can vote to dissolve it. We've tested these mechanics in adversarial testnets.

**Q: What stops someone from hijacking a Sub-DAO?**
**A:** A Sub-DAO can't be run by one actor. Three independent signers are required, and fund disbursements require both donor and global approval. Donors retain veto rights.

**Q: What happens if validator collusion or governance deadlock occurs?**
**A:** The system defaults to the status quo — no upgrade unless broad consensus emerges. In contentious scenarios, this protects liveness while allowing legitimate forks to develop.

**Q: How does the system prevent validator extractive behavior?**
**A:** Our Proof-of-Fee mechanism forces validators to compete on cost-efficiency, not on stake or hardware scale. This discourages centralization and excessive rent-seeking.

**Q: How does the protocol handle black swan events?**
**A:** We’ve already faced one: an exploit that required coordinated upgrade and legal action. The protocol design allows for these rare but critical responses, using the same fork-based mechanism.

### IV. Users & Adoption

**Q: Who uses Open Libra if not app developers or consumers?**
**A:** Our users are institutional: nonprofits, universities, frontier research teams. They don’t want speculative tokens or custody risk. They want sovereign, mission-aligned capital vehicles.

**Q: Do you have any real Sub-DAOs live today?**
**A:** Yes. Sub-DAOs have already been launched by recognized nonprofits, academic groups, and deep tech incubators. They're actively deploying capital, not waiting on promises.

**Q: Why fork Libra instead of building on Ethereum or another chain?**
**A:** We chose Move for its security, auditability, and formalism. We didn’t want a general-purpose app chain. We wanted sovereign infrastructure for long-lived capital.

**Q: How do institutions onboard or launch a Sub-DAO?**
**A:** Sub-DAOs can be launched using open tooling and templates. Any group with a mission can set one up, designate signers, and accept donations. No permission required.

**Q: Why would a donor use this instead of a traditional fund or foundation?**
**A:** Transparency, control, and survivability. Donors retain veto rights. Fund disbursement is recorded on-chain. And the structure is jurisdictionally neutral.

**Q: What is the main value proposition for institutions?**
**A:** The ability to create mission-aligned capital vehicles that operate autonomously, without dependence on legal jurisdictions or third-party custodians.
