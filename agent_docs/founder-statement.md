**Founder Statement: Why Open Libra Exists**

Six years ago, we began building Open Libra to outlast the institutions that couldn’t: foundations, governments, and corporations. We weren’t chasing an app store. We built a sovereign, on-chain endowment. No investors. No foundation. No privileged actors. Just a battle-tested protocol, a freely mined token, and decentralized governance through hard forks.

We forked Libra for its Move language — the most secure smart contract system available — and built an independent economic engine for perpetuity, not hype. We've been attacked, exploited, and tested. We used every tool: software upgrades, social consensus, hard forks, and even the courts. We're still standing. Stronger than before. Open systems are probabilistic. Survival is proof of fitness.

Our users are institutions: nonprofits, universities, research labs. They use Open Libra to launch Sub-DAOs with real mandates and no centralized gatekeeping. Bitcoin showed protocols can outlive founders. Open Libra extends that insight to capital itself.

Perpetuity isn't rhetoric. It's the superpower of digital assets that few see, and that we are mastering.
