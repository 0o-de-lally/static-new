 **founder credibility interview**, aimed at stress-testing your answers across five critical domains:


## üß± I. Foundational Logic & Vision

### TL;DR
Digital assets don‚Äôt die. That‚Äôs their superpower. But most chains treat them like software startups, instead of durable capital. Knowing that is half the battle. The other half: real capital must compound in value.

1. **Why do you believe an on-chain endowment can succeed where traditional institutions fail?**

Traditional institutions are constrained by three fatal flaws: jurisdictional boundaries, key-man risk, and institutional fragility. They exist at the mercy of governments, depend on centralized management, and can be dissolved by regulatory pressure or internal corruption. An on-chain endowment eliminates these single points of failure through technical sovereignty, decentralized governance, and immutable programmability. We've already proven this works‚Äîwe've survived attacks, exploits, and regulatory pressure that would have killed traditional institutions. When Facebook shuttered Libra under government pressure, we forked the code and deployed it in a truly decentralized manner. Traditional endowments can't fork themselves out of regulatory capture.

2. **What would success look like in 1 year, 10 years, and 100 years? Be concrete.**

**1 Year:** A thriving ecosystem of 50+ Sub-DAOs managing $100M+ in combined assets, with institutional adoption by universities and nonprofits. Complete technical infrastructure for sovereign capital deployment, including mature tooling for Sub-DAO creation and management.

**10 Years:** Open Libra becomes one of the world's largest endowments with $10B+ in assets under management across hundreds of specialized Sub-DAOs. Recognition as the premier platform for institutional-grade decentralized capital allocation, with major foundations and endowments migrating to our infrastructure.

**100 Years:** Open Libra persists as an antifragile financial institution that has survived multiple technological paradigm shifts, regulatory regimes, and economic cycles. $LBR tokens serve as the premier store of value for patient capital, with Sub-DAOs stewarding trillions in assets for global public goods.

3. **Why fork Libra/Diem instead of building on existing L1s like Ethereum or Solana?**

Infrastructure sovereignty is non-negotiable for century-scale institutions. Ethereum's gas fees and governance capture by DeFi speculators make it unsuitable for serious institutional capital. Solana's centralization and frequent outages disqualify it for mission-critical operations. Libra/Diem was engineered by Facebook's team of 200+ world-class engineers specifically for institutional-grade financial applications. The Move language provides enhanced security through resource-oriented programming, and the system was designed for global financial institution scale. By forking Diem, we inherited battle-tested infrastructure while gaining complete control over our destiny.

4. **How do you reconcile "perpetual autonomy" with inevitable protocol upgrades, governance crises, or validator churn?**

We learned from Bitcoin: governance-minimized protocol design reduces formal authority and allows innovation at the edges. Our core protocol remains intentionally ossified‚Äîfundamental rules for $LBR issuance, consensus, and basic operations resist change. This provides stability for century-scale planning. Innovation happens through our Sub-DAO ecosystem where specialized governance can experiment without compromising base layer integrity. All changes happen through hard forks with independent validator adoption, forcing multipolar negotiation and protecting against capture. We've already proven this works under stress.

5. **Is "century-scale" a metaphor, or do you expect to build systems that *literally* persist that long? What do you do differently as a result?**

Literally centuries. There are government bonds paying out continuously for 400+ years. Buildings, land titles, and financial firms regularly persist across generations. The fundamental difference is eliminating single points of failure: no company, no jurisdiction, no centralized management. We've engineered antifragile governance that becomes stronger through attempted attacks. Our discount rate calculations assume literally perpetual cash flows, which opens entirely new design spaces for capital allocation. Unlike technology companies that die, blockchain assets have very low risk of disappearing, fundamentally changing the financial equations for long-term value creation.

## ‚öñÔ∏è II. Governance & Game Theory
### TL;DR
Open systems are probabilistic ‚Äî and survival is the strongest signal of fitness. We‚Äôve faced real attacks, exercised every layer of defense ‚Äî social, technical, and legal ‚Äî and each time, came out stronger.


6. **How is Donor Voice safeguarded from whales, plutocrats, or collusion between donors?**

Donor Voice Accounts provide observation rights, veto power, and liquidation authority without concentrating control. Multiple safeguards prevent plutocratic capture: Sub-DAOs require three independent signers, donors can vote to dissolve problematic Sub-DAOs, and the time-weighted Match Index rewards sustained performance over single large donations. Most importantly, donors compete across multiple Sub-DAOs rather than concentrating power in single entities. The system's transparency enables community oversight and social sanctions against bad actors. We've tested these mechanics in adversarial environments and refined them based on real-world attacks.

7. **Can Sub-DAOs fork or exit the system? What prevents malicious fragmentation?**

Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities that can absolutely fork or exit‚Äîthat's a feature, not a bug. Healthy ecosystems require permissionless exit rights. Malicious fragmentation is prevented through economic incentives: Sub-DAOs that fragment lose access to the Match Index and accumulated reputation. Legitimate disagreements result in legitimate forks, which is exactly how innovation should happen. The base protocol remains stable while allowing experimentation at the application layer. This mirrors how Bitcoin's ecosystem evolved through competing implementations and services.

8. **What are the checks and balances between token holders and donors? Who wins in a deadlock?**

Deadlocks default to the status quo‚Äîno action unless broad consensus emerges. Token holders control protocol-level governance through validator coordination, while donors control Sub-DAO resource allocation through Donor Voice Accounts. This separation prevents either group from unilaterally capturing the system. In practice, both groups are aligned around long-term value creation, but when interests diverge, the protocol's ossified design protects against hasty changes. This isn't a zero-sum game‚Äîboth token holders and donors benefit from successful Sub-DAO performance.

9. **How do you measure "performance" in Match Index? Can it be gamed?**

Performance is measured through time-weighted donation volume, Sub-DAO asset growth, and community reputation scores. Gaming is mitigated through several mechanisms: newer donations carry more weight than older ones, multiple independent signers are required, and donors retain veto rights over disbursements. The system rewards sustained performance over short-term manipulation. We've run adversarial testnets specifically to identify and patch gaming vectors. Perfect game-theory-proof systems don't exist, but we've built robust defenses against the most obvious attack vectors.

10. **What's your governance upgrade path if something breaks catastrophically?**

The same path that already works: coordinated action by independent validators backed by social consensus. No emergency powers, no multisig backdoors, just resilient infrastructure and reputation-weighted influence. We've already successfully navigated a catastrophic exploit that required coordinated upgrade and legal action against attackers. The process succeeded because validators independently chose to adopt updated software after community deliberation. This fork-based governance protects against capture while enabling necessary responses to genuine emergencies.

## üõ† III. Technical Execution & Security
### TL;DR
A best in class blockchain sponsored by hundreds of millions of dollars by Facebook. Our innovations are economic games rooted that are purpose-build for our unique destination.
11. **What is the state of your codebase? Is it in production, audited, or under testnet use?**

Open Libra has been in production since 2019, running for 6+ years with billions in transactions processed. Our codebase is fully open-source and battle-tested through real-world usage, attacks, and exploits. We've successfully navigated hard forks, validator transitions, and protocol upgrades under adversarial conditions. The system has been stress-tested through economic cycles and regulatory pressure. Unlike many blockchain projects, we're not in testnet or beta‚Äîthis is production-grade infrastructure that institutions are already using for real capital deployment.

12. **Why was the Move language a strategic fit for this platform, given tooling and developer availability?**

Move provides enhanced security for financial applications through resource-oriented programming that prevents common smart contract vulnerabilities. Unlike Solidity's account-based model, Move's resource types make assets truly "move" between accounts, preventing double-spending and reentrancy attacks. For institutional capital, security trumps developer convenience. We're not building a general-purpose app platform‚Äîwe're building specialized infrastructure for capital deployment. Move's formalism and auditability are worth the trade-off in developer ecosystem size. The language was designed by Facebook's team specifically for institutional financial applications.

13. **How is validator consensus different from typical BFT or PoS systems? How does "Proof of Fee" work under real-world usage?**

Proof of Fee forces validators to compete on operational efficiency rather than capital stake or computational power. Validators propose the lowest fees they're willing to accept, and selection probability is weighted by efficiency and reputation. This reduces centralization pressures and rent-seeking behavior common in PoS systems. Under real-world usage, we've observed healthy competition driving fees down while maintaining network security through reputation mechanisms. Long-term performance matters more than short-term bidding, creating incentives for reliable, cost-effective validation.

14. **Do "Slow Wallets" require social consensus enforcement or is it cryptoeconomically enforced?**

Slow Wallets are enforced entirely through protocol logic‚Äîno social consensus required. The vesting mechanism is cryptoeconomically guaranteed through smart contract code that cannot be bypassed. Daily distribution amounts are fixed and automatic, with no way to accelerate vesting regardless of social pressure or market conditions. This "First In, Last Out" structure is mathematically enforced, creating predictable liquidity schedules that encourage long-term participation. The system works regardless of community sentiment or social coordination.

15. **How does the system respond to lost keys, black swan events, or civil attacks on matching funds?**

Lost keys are handled through multi-signature requirements for Sub-DAOs and recovery mechanisms for individual accounts. Black swan events are addressed through the same governance mechanisms we've already used successfully: validator coordination and hard forks when necessary. Civil attacks on matching funds are mitigated through decentralized fund storage, multiple independent signers, and rapid response capabilities. We've already faced and survived coordinated attacks, including legal warfare and technical exploits. The system's antifragile design becomes stronger through adversarial testing.

## üåé IV. Adoption & Ecosystem
### TL;DR
Forget users and developers, this is not your naive Layer-1 play. Institutions deploying long term capital for public goods are our target.

16. **Who are your first users, and what can they do on Day 1?**

Our users are institutions: nonprofits, universities, research labs, and frontier technology companies. On Day 1, they can launch Sub-DAOs, accept donations, deploy capital through transparent governance, and participate in the Match Index for additional funding. They get sovereign capital vehicles without dependence on traditional financial intermediaries or legal jurisdictions. Real institutions are already using these capabilities to manage millions in assets across multiple active Sub-DAOs.

17. **How do you onboard a Sub-DAO? What tooling exists for founders, builders, and donors?**

Sub-DAO creation uses open tooling and templates that any group with a mission can deploy. The process requires designating three independent signers, defining governance parameters, and submitting to community review. Existing tools include wallet integration, governance interfaces, and transparent fund tracking. No permission required from central authorities‚Äîany legitimate organization can launch a Sub-DAO and begin accepting donations immediately. We've streamlined the process based on feedback from early institutional adopters.

18. **How do you bootstrap liquidity and incentives without moral hazard or ponzinomics?**

We solved the bootstrap problem through proof-of-labor rather than token sales. All $LBR was freely mined over three years with no pre-mine or insider allocation. 95% of supply is locked in Slow Wallets, creating natural scarcity and preventing speculation. Incentives come from real capital deployment and matching fund rewards based on performance, not artificial yield farming. This approach eliminated the moral hazard of promising returns to early investors while ensuring patient capital is rewarded through the Match Index.

19. **Why would a donor trust Open Libra over existing donor-advised funds or grantmaking DAOs?**

Complete transparency, sovereign control, and perpetual existence. Every transaction is recorded immutably on-chain, donors retain veto rights over disbursements, and the infrastructure operates beyond jurisdictional capture. Traditional donor-advised funds depend on financial intermediaries and regulatory frameworks that can change or fail. Existing grantmaking DAOs lack institutional-grade infrastructure and security. Open Libra provides the benefits of both‚Äîprofessional capital management with complete transparency and donor control‚Äîwhile eliminating single points of failure.

20. **Are there real Sub-DAOs in the pipeline, or are these still hypotheticals?**

Multiple Sub-DAOs are already live and actively deploying capital, launched by recognized nonprofits, academic institutions, and deep technology incubators. These aren't pilot programs or demos‚Äîthey're managing real assets for real missions. We can't name specific organizations without permission, but institutional adoption is growing as universities and foundations recognize the advantages of sovereign capital deployment. The pipeline includes additional academic institutions and several major foundations evaluating migration to our infrastructure.

## üî• V. Political & Regulatory Realism

Open Libra never sold tokens or raised capital into the protocol. Every coin was freely mined, and any pooling of capital happens downstream ‚Äî by users, not by the chain. Most existing sub-DAOs were donation-based, not investment vehicles.

21. **What's your jurisdictional posture? Do you plan to geo-fence, anonymize, or engage regulators?**

We operate as neutral infrastructure without jurisdictional preference. The protocol itself imposes no geographic restrictions‚Äîit's software that runs on decentralized infrastructure. Sub-DAOs operating in regulated jurisdictions are responsible for local compliance, keeping the base layer credibly neutral. We engage regulators through educational outreach and industry participation but maintain technical sovereignty. Our clean legal foundation (no ICO, no fundraising) provides strong protection against regulatory overreach while enabling constructive engagement where appropriate.

22. **How do you explain the project's legality to a skeptical journalist, regulator, or institutional investor?**

Open Libra operates as neutral software infrastructure, similar to the internet protocols that enable email or web browsing. Every $LBR token was fairly mined with no sales or securities offerings. The protocol pools no funds and promises no returns‚Äîit simply enables autonomous capital deployment through code. Sub-DAOs are separate legal entities responsible for their own compliance. Our regulatory position is strengthened by six years of operation without legal challenges and adoption by legitimate institutions. We provide the rails; users are responsible for their own regulatory compliance.

23. **What parts of the system could be considered financial instruments or securities under U.S. law?**

The base protocol issues no promises and facilitates no investments‚Äîit's neutral infrastructure. $LBR tokens were freely mined and represent computational access rights, not investment contracts. Sub-DAOs might trigger securities law if they pool funds and promise returns, but most operate as donation-based entities focused on public goods. Our legal analysis suggests the protocol itself remains outside securities regulation, though specific Sub-DAO implementations could require compliance depending on their structure and jurisdiction. This separation protects the base layer while enabling regulatory compliance at the application level.

24. **Is there any KYC? If not, how do you avoid being classified as an unregistered fund manager?**

The protocol imposes no KYC requirements‚Äîit's neutral infrastructure like Bitcoin or Ethereum. We avoid fund manager classification because we don't manage funds, pool capital, or promise returns. Open Libra provides software tools; Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities that may implement their own KYC requirements based on local law. This architectural separation ensures the base protocol remains legally neutral while enabling compliance at the application layer. Fund management happens at the Sub-DAO level, not the protocol level.

Sub-DAOs are autonomous entities responsible for their own legal compliance and risk management. The protocol provides infrastructure but exercises no control over Sub-DAO decisions. If a Sub-DAO violates local law, consequences fall on that entity and its operators, not the neutral protocol. This is identical to how email servers aren't liable for user communications or how cloud providers aren't responsible for customer applications. Our decentralized architecture ensures that problems with individual Sub-DAOs don't compromise the broader ecosystem or protocol operation.
